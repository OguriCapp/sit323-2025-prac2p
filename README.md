This project is a simple web page using Node.js and Express framework to finish Task2.1P on OnTrack.

Firstly, I import Express, create an Express app and set paths.

Secondly, I create public folder to put some static files like Icon.jpg (Deakin Icon), index.html and style.css in it.

Then I create a simple HTML web page by using some knowledeg I have learned before, including simple titles and form and display of Deakin's icon.

Finally I start the server on port 8080 and write a console message to cheack it conveniently.
